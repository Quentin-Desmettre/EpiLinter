## **What can it do ?**
This extension currently checks every error that [Banana](https://github.com/Epitech/coding-style-checker) checks.

In fact, this extension uses Banana to find and display errors - Which make this extension *really* powerful, as it boosts your productivity by allowing you to get your coding style errors without having to run Banana through your terminal.

<br>

## **Requirements**

To run this extension, you will need on your computer:
* An [Internet access](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)
* A Python interpreter, version >= 3.6
